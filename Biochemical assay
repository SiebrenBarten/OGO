% Step 1: Biochemical assay to determine collagen volume fraction in healthy pleural tissue

% Load the data file containing the measurements of the tissue sample
    %The data file 'tissue_sample_data.mat' contains the variables 'sample_volume' 
    %(in mm^3) and 'sample_mass' (in g) which have been previously measured 
    %for the tissue sample.
data = load('tissue_sample_data.mat');

% Determine the volume of the tissue sample
sample_volume = data.sample_volume; % in mm^3

% Weigh the tissue sample to determine its mass
sample_mass = data.sample_mass; % in g

% Perform the biochemical assay to determine the collagen content of the tissue
collagen_content = 0.5; % Replace with results from biochemical assay!!!!

% Calculate the collagen volume fraction in the tissue sample
collagen_volume = collagen_content * sample_volume; % in mm^3
total_volume = sample_volume; % in mm^3
collagen_volume_fraction = collagen_volume / total_volume; % as a decimal fraction

% Display the result
fprintf('Collagen volume fraction in the tissue sample is %.2f.\n', collagen_volume_fraction);
