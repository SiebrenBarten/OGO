% Step 1: Biochemical assay to determine collagen volume fraction in healthy pleural tissue

% Load the data file containing the measurements of the tissue samples
% The data file 'tissue_sample_data.mat' contains the variables 'sample_volume'
% (in mm^3) and 'sample_mass' (in g) which have been previously measured
% for each tissue sample.
data = load('tissue_sample_data.mat');

% Determine the volume of the tissue samples
sample_volumes = data.sample_volumes; % in mm^3

% Weigh the tissue samples to determine their mass
sample_masses = data.sample_masses; % in g

% Perform the biochemical assay to determine the collagen content of each tissue sample
% Here, we assume that you have a vector or array of collagen content values,
% with one value for each tissue sample.
collagen_contents = data.sample_collagen_contents;

% Calculate the collagen volume fractions for each tissue sample
collagen_volumes = collagen_contents .* sample_volumes; % in mm^3
total_volumes = sample_volumes; % in mm^3
collagen_volume_fractions = collagen_volumes ./ total_volumes; % as decimal fractions

% Display the results
num_samples = length(sample_volumes);
for i = 1:num_samples
fprintf('Collagen volume fraction in tissue sample %d is %.2f.\n', i, collagen_volume_fractions(i));
end
